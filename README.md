# AIcadum_interview
This is a repository specifically created for the coding section of the interview process:

Here is a summary of steps:
The preprocessing and training steps were done in "training_code_AIcadium.ipynb", as a result an ML classifier was trained and saved as "classifier.pkl"
Through the training process various classifier has been tested and RandomForest was identified as the model with the best performance
Then the obtained ML model was deployed using "Flask" as "app.ipynb"/"app.py"
"to_run.ipynb" script has been provided to implement the app to predict whether a particular customer buy the product
